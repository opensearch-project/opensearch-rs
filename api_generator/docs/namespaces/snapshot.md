Snapshot APIs

[Manage snapshots taken from a running OpenSearch cluster](https://opensearch.org/docs/opensearch/rest-api/index/).
A snapshot is a backup of individual
indices or the entire cluster, stored in a repository on a shared filesystem or a remote repository
on S3, HDFS, Azure, Google Cloud storage, and more.
